# Cesar-Encryption

  This is a program that encrypts any string by shifting every letter a certain number of times, depending on the given key. Note that       anything other than lower case or upper case letters isn't considered in the shifting.  

  *This program was created in the framework of my studies at UDEM.

# What I learned

  • .charAt and other text manipulations
